# Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC)

In this repository, a Python implementation of the Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method, originally proposed by Booth *et al.* in [*Fermion Monte Carlo without fixed nodes: A game of life, death, and annihilation in Slater determinant space*](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/131/5/054106/902018/Fermion-Monte-Carlo-without-fixed-nodes-A-game-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext) is provided. This code was developed as part of an undergraduate thesis at Internatinal Christian University.
